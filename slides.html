# .more-line-height[🧐 What makes Haskell <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .strike[hard] special]

# 🐉 A different beast

Haskell (and FP) have brought many ideas to the table: .font60[(list not complete)]

.font90[
- Higher-order functions
    - Higher-rank and impredicativity
- Algebraic data types and pattern matching
- Purity and laziness
- Type-directed contexts with type classes
    - Functors and monads everywhere
- Working with and manipulating types
]

---

# Haskell's Manifesto (about design)

### .grey[Define **data** in a simple way]

.little-margin-top[
- Enforce _invariants_ at compile-time
- Powerful _pattern matching_
]

### .grey[Use types to **guide** your program]

.little-margin-top[
- Be explicit about your constraints
- Compiler-based DI
]

### .grey[Think about **side effects**]

.little-margin-top[
- No tag = no side effects (pure)
]

---

# Haskell `data` is mainstream

Some ideas are nowadays in <br /> Scala / Kotlin / Java / C# / Swift:

- Higher-order functions
- Algebraic data types
    - Records / data classes
    - Sealed hierarchies

> Learn concepts in a familiar setting

---

# Purity

Anything outside computation (**side effects**) is marked in the type:

```haskell
(++) :: String -> String -> String
readContents :: String -> IO String
```

This **restricts** composition:

- Forces a _pure core / effectful edges_ design
- Drawing the line is difficult at first

---

# Laziness

This function is short-circuiting:

```haskell
and :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
and False _ = False
and _     x = x
```

In Haskell computations are executed:

- Only when needed
- As much as they are needed

---

## This is .grey[**hard**]!

# Our tool manager: `ghcup`

> Easiest way to get a working environment

Similar to SDKMAN, Coursier, `rustup`...

```
> ghcup install ghc recommended
> ghcup install cabal recommended
> ghcup install stack recommended
> ghcup install hls recommended
```

ℹ️ Don't worry about versions for now

---

# Our editor integration: HLS

Based on Language Server Protocol

- Support from VS Code to Emacs
- In VS Code, just install the _Haskell_ plug-in

⚠️ Sometimes HLS support lags behind

- You can check support with `ghcup list`

.code60[
```
✗  ghc   8.10.6   base-4.14.3.0             hls-powered
✔✔ ghc   8.10.7   recommended,base-4.14.3.0 hls-powered
✓  ghc   9.0.1    base-4.15.0.0             hls-powered
✗  ghc   9.2.1    latest,base-4.16.0.0

# Start a new project

Not one, but two choices: .font60[(why, in just a second)]

```

Another good tool is .grey[🔮 Summoner]

- Good set of default warnings
- Additons like GH Actions integration

# Cabal vs. `cabal` vs. `.cabal`

> Haskell's build tool story is **messy**

- **Packages** are the unit of distribution
    - Package = set of modules
    - Module = source file = thing you import
- Each package comes with a **build file**
    - Dependencies, exposed modules, flags
    - In the `<package-name>.cabal` file
    - Often called _the Cabal file_

---

# Simple Cabal file

.less-line-height[.font90[
Not JSON, not YAML, something in between

Each **stanza** defines libraries or executables
]]

.code70[
```

  main-is:          Main.hs

# Build tools: Cabal and Stack

You can **build** such package in two ways:

1. Cabal: `cabal build`
2. Stack: `stack build`
    - May require `stack init`

---

# Build tools: Cabal and Stack

You can **build** such package in two ways:

1. Cabal: `cabal build`
2. Stack: `stack build`

The choice is nuanced, but in general terms:
.little-margin-top[.font90[
- Stack focuses on reproducibility by default
- Cabal supports reproducible tools via `freeze`
- Stack tracks your toolchain (installs GHC)
- Cabal doesn't, but we have `ghcup` now
]]

---

# Dependencies: Stackage and Hackage

Stacks requires an additional `stack.yaml` file

.code80[
```yaml
resolver: lts-18.14  # package set
packages:
  - .                # your project
```
]

A **resolver** defines a set of fixed packages and their versions known to .grey[build together]

- Haskell packages are built from source
- Because of strong typing, this is a **huge deal**

---

# Stackage - `stackage.org`

**LTS** targets the "recommended" GHC version

- new minor version of LTS only updates minor version of the packages

**Nightly** targets one version more

- more recent version of packages
- at some point, they "graduate" to LTS

What about the **most** recent version?

---

# Hackage - `hackage.haskell.org`

> **The** repository for Haskell packages

All version of packages + their documentation

---

# Hackage - `hackage.haskell.org`

> **The** repository for Haskell packages

All version of packages + their documentation

You can add Hackage packages to Stack

```yaml
resolver: lts-18.14
packages:
  - .
extra-deps:
  - nice-dependency-0.24.5
```

---

# 🧱 Summary

.margin-top[
- Packages are defined in `.cabal` files
- Cabal and Stack are used to build them
- We have two sources for dependencies:
    - Stackage for curated sets
    - Hackage for everything
- Stack leans towards Stackage

# Haskell-the-language

> The language itself vs. the **compilers**

There is more than one Haskell compiler:

- GHC, from Glasgow
- Helium and UHC, from Utrecht
- Mu, used internally
- LHC, JHC, ...

---

# Haskell-the-language

> The language itself vs. the **compilers**

There is more than one Haskell compiler:

- **GHC** is _de facto_ the standard
- _Helium_, in research, and UHC
- _Mu_, used internally
- LHC, JHC, ..., not maintained

---

# Haskell-the-language

> The **language** itself vs. the compilers

**Report** = Haskell "standard"

- Current: Haskell 2010
- Previously: Haskell 98

---

# Haskell-the-language

> The **language** itself vs. the compilers

**Report** = Haskell "standard"

- Current: Haskell 2010
- Previously: Haskell 98

> You sometimes hear people saying they write "Haskell 2010" (or 98) code to mean code without GHC extensions

---

# Extensions

> Anything outside the Report

- Syntactical goodies
- Type classes with multiple parameters
- Type families
- More ways to use `deriving`
- And other 20+ things

## ℹ️ Extension `/=` unsupported or bad style

---

# Extensions

> Anything outside the Report

To enable one, you write **first thing** in the file

```haskell
{-# language MultiParamTypeClasses #-}
-- this also works, but no need to shout 🗣️
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveFunctor #-}
```

Usual joke: a Haskell file is 20 lines extensions, 30 lines type definitions, and 3 lines of code

---

# Type level

> Working with types as easy as with values

.code60[
```haskell
{-# language TypeFamilies #-}

type family MakeOpt (t :: Type) :: Type where
  MakeOpt (Maybe    a) = Maybe a  -- already optional
  MakeOpt (Either e a) = Maybe a  -- simplify
  MakeOpt t            = Maybe t  -- other cases
```
]

.code60[
```haskell
{-# language GADTs, DataKinds #-}

data SafeString (escaped :: Bool) where
  Unsafe  :: String -> SafeString 'False
  Escaped :: String -> SafeString 'True
```
]

# Type level

> Working with types as easy as with values

This is **advanced** Haskell

- But we love to talk about it! 💜
- Lots of exploration and research

The *Stitch* paper by Eisenberg is awesome 💎

# `GHC2021`

Many extensions have been stable for _decades_ <br />
... yet they won't make into a new Report

`GHC2021` is the standard "language version" since (the recently released) 9.2

Stemming from the **GHC Steering Committee**

- Oversee new extensions to the language
- Similar to processes in other communities

# Category Theory

> A branch of mathematics talking about the abstract structure of things

There's a lot of cross-pollination 🐝

- Functor or monad come from there
- Type theories are influenced by PL research

# Category Theory

> A branch of mathematics talking about the abstract structure of things

There's a lot of cross-pollination 🐝

However, it's a scary topic for many 👻

- Not really needed to start with Haskell
- But nevertheless _really_ interesting
